The Python Image Processor is a simple image manipulation tool that allows you to apply various filters and perform advanced operations on image files. You can add  red, green, blue, sepia, warm, and cold filter effects and even rotate, resize, or locate a yellow fish in an image.

## Installation

To get started, you need to ensure that you have Python installed on your system. You can download Python from the official website (https://www.python.org/downloads/).

Next, you'll need to install the pygame library, which is used for image processing. You can do this using pip. Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command:
```
pip install pygame
```
## Usage

Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

Place the image files you want to process in the samples/ directory within the project folder.

Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.

Run the image_processor.py script with Python. You can do this by running the following command:

```
python image_processor.py
```

## Features
### Filters

- Red Filter: Applies a red filter to the image.
- Green Filter: Applies a green filter to the image.
- Blue Filter: Applies a blue filter to the image.
- Sepia Filter: Gives the image a sepia-tone effect.
- Warm Filter: Adds a warm, orange hue to the image.
- Cold Filter: Adds a cold, bluish tint to the image.

### Advanced Functions

- Rotate Left: Rotates the image 90 degrees counterclockwise.
- Rotate Right: Rotates the image 90 degrees clockwise.
- Double the Size: Increases the size of the image by a factor of 2.
- Half the Size: Reduces the size of the image by a factor of 2.
- Locate the Fish: Identifies yellow objects in the image and draws a box around them.

### Other Functions
- Reset: Don't like the changes you made? You can quickly reset the image to its original state.
- Save: Save your resulting image where ever you want.

## Sample Images
